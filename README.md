## Introduction
We Suck at Drawing is a web based free [Drawful 2](http://jackboxgames.com/project/drawful2/) clone, it's built in JavaScript/HTML and the server runs on nodejs. The project was created due to the limited number of players that could play in each Drawful 2 match. We Suck at Drawing allows up to 20 players to have fun together and the Not Safe For Work (NSFW) toggle can help make your next family get-together extra akward.

## Install
This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) along with [Socket.io](http://www.socket.io) and [Express](http://www.expressjs.com). Go check them out if you don't already have them installed locally. Alternatively this repo already has the node modules installed and will keep them up to date.

## Usage
### Server
To launch the server just run the server.js file with nodejs.

### Client
#### Host
To access the web page open a browser and go to localhost:1234, the host device will generate a room code.

Once everyone is ready to play someone has to click the 'Ready' button on the host and everything else will explain itself.
