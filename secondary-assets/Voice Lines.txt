BOOM! It's game time, I hope you've warmed up your drawing fingers because it's about to get, wierd. Let's go!

OK! I'v sent a prompt to each of your devices. It's probally something... kind of... wierd... like botchelsim, or... some other wierd thing that I can't think of right now. Draw a picture that would have that title, and when you're done hit send. You'll get points for each player that can correctly guesses your title, so have fun!

Great! All the pictures are in, some of them are wonderful and the others are... well, let's just get started.

Oh crap! You're in over time, you're losing points until you finish your drawing.

Hurry up, you're losing a ton of points here!

At this point you might as well just send it, you'll probally lose anyways.

Well it looks like someone is being a salty scrub today, we'll just kick them so everyone else can still play.

Now, use your device to come up with a prompt for what ever this drawing could be.

And here are your choices, one of them is the real title.

And here are your answers, if you chose the green title you were correct! But if you chose a red title, well... maybe you can rest easy knowing you're helping to secure someone elses victory.

And here are the scores after the first round, if you're not in the top 3 just keep telling yourself that it's just a game. Just try not to hypervenalate, we wouldn't want you to ruining the fun for everyone else.
